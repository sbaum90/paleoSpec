Note that all these spectra are computed for a benchmark 
uranium-238 concentration of 10^{-10} atoms 238U per 
molecule of the target material. Note that they are
already weighted for the abundance of the respective
target isotopes and elements.
To convert them to a concentration C^238 per weight,
multiply the spectra by 
(m_mol^X/m_mol^238) x (C^238 / 10^-10)
where
m_mol^X - molar mass of the target molecule
m_mol^238 - molar mass uf 238U
